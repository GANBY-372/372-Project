# Java Packages
Putting source code does not make it into a package. Even putting the import will not 
include the directory's code in the build/run.Make sure you are in PACKAGES view if you need
to do any operations with packages.

You can drag, drop, copy, cut, delete files from the Pacakges pane. You can drag folders from 
the desktop into IntelliJ and it will detect them. They made the packages view for a reason
NOt using it to create, move, delete packages can cause problems.

We can always talk about our best practices for using packages in our Java projects.
