# Where Files Will Go

## Source Code Location
Source code goes in the src package. Don't put anything else in here. A package might need a Javadoc. If a class
needs to be documented the class should have comments and a JavaDoc.

## README
This is the first thing people will see. It should be at the project's root. The README.md says where the to find
the rest of the project's documentation.

## Documentation Folder
This should not be in the source tree. The documentation folder is in the project's root directory. 
#### Contents
- A build-instructions.txt if necessary
- Requirements.txt: the JDK version, tools, and libraries required.
- Diagrams folder: UML, sequence, and use case diagrams.

## Changelog.txt
People summarize what they were doing with that week's commits or any other project work. If they put resources on 
figma, a google doc, any other location outside the project a link needs to be included in their log.
